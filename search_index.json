designed to help you contribute to the website.\nHow to edit a page\nTo edit a page, just find it in the github repository and edit from there, or pull the repository and edit it on your PC. Then push to master:\ngit push -u origin master\n\nand the action script should push it to the pages website. Don't push to the gh-pages repo as this is the backend for rendering the website etc. \nHow to create a new page\nAdd the page to the necessary place in the github repository. Then, add it to the SUMMARY.md file as a member of a nested list in the correct section, and link the page name to the page itself using the following syntax: \n* [section name](path/to/section.md)\n    * [page name](path/to/page.md)\n\nThe indentation between layers is four spaces. Also, make sure there is a space between the asterisk and the page name, or it won't work. It is best if we keep the pages saved in a directory with the same name as the section. \nHow to create a new section\nTo create a new section, do the same as you would do to add a new page, but when adding it to the SUMMARY.md file, put it as a top level element in the list: \n* [new section name](path/to/section.md)\n\nWhen you've created a new section page, also create a new directory in which files relating to that section can be stored. \nHow to edit and preview locally\nTo preview the website quickly you can build and host it locally. On Linux this requires you to install gitbook-cli which can be accomplished using the commands\nsudo apt install npm\nsudo npm install -g gitbook-cli\n\nAssuming the wiki is in the folder ./wiki/ then you can the plugins listed in ./wiki/book.json  using the command \ngitbook install ./wiki/\n\nFinally, you can start hosting the website locally using the command \ngitbook serve ./wiki/\n\nWith the website hosted locally saved changes cause the website to refresh and thus appear instantly.\nvar className='atoc';"},"help/markdown.html":{"url":"help/markdown.html","title":"Markdown Help","keywords":"","body":"Help\nThis file is designed to help with building markdown files. \nCode blocks\nYou can add code blocks in the following way: \n\n​```language\ncode goes here\n\nWhere language is the name of the programming language that you are putting in the block.

For example suppose that you are particularly lazy and  hate the having to stage ., commit and push changes across three commands then it is possible to define a single command to do all three at once, git-lazy. \nTo define aliases we should :\n\nCreate an file at ~/bash_aliases.sh. \n\nAdd the line below code  to ~/.bashrc, so that the commands you define in ~/bash_aliases.sh will be loaded when ~/.bashrc is sourced. \n\n\nif [ -f ~/bash_aliases.sh ]; then\n    . ~/bash_aliases.sh\nfi\n\n\nDefine your aliases in ~/bash_aliases.sh using the syntax \nalias =''\n\nwhere  is the command you wish to shorten and  is the short-hand alias you wish to assign it to.  You can also define bash functions here.\n\nFinally, so that either you must source ~/.bashrc. This happens automatically every time a terminal is opened, but to avoid having to reopen the terminal you can source it manually with the command \nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\nAs an example a alias to open ~/bash_aliases.sh in our favourite text editor gedit then source ~/bash_aliases.sh when we close gedit would be \nalias edit-aliases='\ngedit ~/.bash_aliases.sh; \nprintf \"Sourcing ~/.bashrc \\n\";\nsource ~/.bashrc\n'\n\nThe git-lazy command discussed above is better suited to a bash function owing the the necessity of a git commit message. \nfunction git-lazy() {\n    git stage .\n    git commit -a -m \"$1\"\n    git push\n}\n\nSuch a function uses the first argument as the commit message. For example git-lazy 'commit message' will stage all changes in the directory, commit them with the commit message 'commit message'then push them to the relevant remote.  \nThe final thing you can do in ~/bash_aliases.sh is set file paths to be ignored with terminal auto-complete. This is achieved with the  FIGNORE command followed by a colon separated list of file names to ignore. For example if we wished to ignore all the files autogenerated by the latex compiler the command would be    \nFIGNORE=\".log:.bbl:.aux:.blg:.toc:.out\"\n\n[Barnaby]\nvar className='atoc';"},"documentation/drivers.html":{"url":"documentation/drivers.html","title":"Drivers","keywords":"","body":"Drivers\nvar className='atoc';"},"documentation/drivers/zurich.html":{"url":"documentation/drivers/zurich.html","title":"Zurich","keywords":"","body":"Zurich Instruments lock-in driver documentation\nvar className='atoc';"},"readout/readout.html":{"url":"readout/readout.html","title":"Readout","keywords":"","body":"var className='atoc';"},"ml/ml.html":{"url":"ml/ml.html","title":"Machine learning","keywords":"","body":"What are the chances this works?\nvar className='atoc';"},"papers/papers.html":{"url":"papers/papers.html","title":"Papers","keywords":"","body":"Papers\nThis section is for storing notes on papers.

Single qubit gates are implemented using microwave cavity, two qubit gates via exchange interactions and read out by gate based dispersive readout. They suggest how transistor based control circuit with charge storage electrodes could be used to operate a dense and scalable two dimensional qubit system. \nIn classical computing Silicon based CMOS integrated circuits (ICs) have scaled to billions of transistors. A key architectural aspect of IC is the parallel addressing through word line and bit line, facilitating  rapid read and write operations on large 2D arrays of bits. Unfortunately, this cannot be applied directly to qubit arrays. As the tolerance levels are small so each qubit must be individually tunable. \nThis paper develops an architecture which allows for parallel addressing of silicon spin qubits, while solving the tunability issue through 'floating memory gate electrodes' that can be routinely reset, similar to dynamic random access memory. Their architecture requires O(N)\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})O(√​N​​​) lines for NN N qubits. \nPhysical Architecture\nThe general architecture proposed uses a layered Silicon wafer, where the lowest layer is isotopically enriched silicon-28, to host the qubits. The layers above need not be enriched as they will hold the classical circuitry. The layers are interconnected by metal lines. There will be a singe floating gate for quantum dot definition and another to control the nearest neighbour coupling.  Individual qubit addressing in achieved through a combination of word and bit lines. \n\nThey estimate that if the feature size, ie the minimal width between gates and undoped regions is λ\\lambdaλ then the classical control structure will occupy an area 80λ280 \\lambda^{2}80λ​2​​ above the qubit. A features size of λ=7\\lambda = 7 λ=7nm, consistent with current AMD consumer processors, leads to a qubit size of 63×6363 \\times 6363×63nm. \nReadout\nThere are two popular readout schemes: \n\nReadout based on the Zeeman energy (using a reservoir) \nReadout based on singlet-triplet energy using Pauli spin blockade.  They estimate that the Pauli spin blockade energy is about 1meV. \n\nThey favour the spin blockade technique because \n\nthe larger energy scale leads to a better fidelity \nit not necessitating for each qubit to be attached to a reservoir\nit does no require a large magnetic field.  \n\nThe readout they propose requires a reference dot, which sits in the ground state. They then try to force the dots together and determine the spin dependant charge state using gate based dispersive readout. Thus only half the qubits would be available to be read out.  They suggest extensive multiplexing, but I do not know how feasible it will be. \nHeat Dissipation\nOf critical importance to large scale quantum computing is heat dissipation/cooling power. They estimate the heat produced by the control electronics and how much heat a cryostat could remove and conclude an operating temperature of 100100100mK. \n[Barnaby]\nvar className='atoc';"},"ideas/ideas.html":{"url":"ideas/ideas.html","title":"Ideas","keywords":"","body":"var className='atoc';"},"intuitions/intuitions.html":{"url":"intuitions/intuitions.html","title":"Intuitions","keywords":"","body":"var className='atoc';"},"qanda/qanda.html":{"url":"qanda/qanda.html","title":"Q&A","keywords":"","body":"Questions and Answers\n\n\nQuestion Title [tag]\n\n\nI decree the format shall be: \nQuestion Title [tag]\nQ: Question ...
