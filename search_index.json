Don't push to the gh-pages repo as this is the backend for rendering the website etc. \nHow to create a new page\nAdd the page to the necessary place in the github repository. Then, add it to the SUMMARY.md file as a member of a nested list in the correct section, and link the page name to the page itself using the following syntax: \n* [section name](path/to/section.md)\n    * [page name](path/to/page.md)\n\nThe indentation between layers is four spaces. Also, make sure there is a space between the asterisk and the page name, or it won't work. It is best if we keep the pages saved in a directory with the same name as the section. \nHow to create a new section\nTo create a new section, do the same as you would do to add a new page, but when adding it to the SUMMARY.md file, put it as a top level element in the list: \n* [new section name](path/to/section.md)\n\nWhen you've created a new section page, also create a new directory in which files relating to that section can be stored. \nHow to write equations\nThe website supports inline or block LaTeX equations. The easiest way to add such equations is through a MathJax compatible markdown writer - Typora for example.\nExample of inline equation: ax2+bx+c=0 a x^2 + bx + c = 0 ax​2​​+bx+c=0\nExample of math-block: \n∫−∞∞e−x2dx=π\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \\sqrt{\\pi}\n∫​−∞​∞​​e​−x​2​​​​dx=√​π​​​\nHow to edit and preview locally\nTo preview the website quickly you can build and host it locally. On Linux this requires you to install gitbook-cli which can be accomplished using the commands\nsudo apt install npm\nsudo npm install -g gitbook-cli\n\nAssuming the wiki is in the folder ./wiki/ then you can the plugins listed in ./wiki/book.json  using the command \ngitbook install ./wiki/\n\nFinally, you can start hosting the website locally using the command \ngitbook serve ./wiki/\n\nWith the website hosted locally saved changes cause the website to refresh and thus appear instantly.\nvar className='atoc';"},"templates/help.html":{"url":"templates/help.html","title":"Help","keywords":"","body":"Help\nThis file is designed to help with building markdown files. \nCode blocks\nYou can add code blocks in the following way: \n\n```language\ncode goes here\n```\n\nwhere language is the name of the programming language that you are putting in the block.

Veldhorst\nA paper discussing the how a CMOS architecture for spin-1/21/21/2 qubits might be scaled.  Single qubit gates are implemented using microwave cavity, two qubit gates via exchange interactions and read out by gate based dispersive readout. They suggest how transistor based control circuit with charge storage electrodes could be used to operate a dense and scalable two dimensional qubit system. \nIn classical computing Silicon based CMOS integrated circuits (ICs) have scaled to billions of transistors. A key architectural aspect of IC is the parallel addressing through word line and bit line, facilitating  rapid read and write operations on large 2D arrays of bits. Unfortunately, this cannot be applied directly to qubit arrays. As the tolerance levels are small so each qubit must be individually tunable. \nThis paper develops an architecture which allows for parallel addressing of silicon spin qubits, while solving the tunability issue through 'floating memory gate electrodes' that can be routinely reset, similar to dynamic random access memory. Their architecture requires O(N)\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})O(√​N​​​) lines for NN N qubits. \nPhysical Architecture\nThe general architecture proposed\nvar className='atoc';"},"ideas/ideas.html":{"url":"ideas/ideas.html","title":"Ideas","keywords":"","body":"var className='atoc';"}}}
