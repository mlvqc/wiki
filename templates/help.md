# Help 

This file is designed to help with building markdown files. 

### Code blocks 

You can add code blocks in the following way: 

````markdown 

```language
code goes here
```

````

where language is the name of the programming language that you are putting in the block. There is support for a lot of languages. 
Python (python) and C++ (cpp) are two that we might use often. 

### Table of contents 

You can add a table of contents to a page by including the following in the markdown file: 

```markdown
<!-- toc --> 
```

The table of contents is then rendered in that position.
