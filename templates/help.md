# Help 

This file is designed to help with building markdown files. 

### Code blocks 

You can add code blocks in the following way: 

````markdown 

â€‹```language
code goes here
```

Where language is the name of the programming language that you are putting in the block. There is support for a lot of languages. Python (python) and bash (sh) are two that we might use often.  

Python: 

````python
def sum(a, b): 
    return a + b
```

Bash:

```bash
sudo apt update; 
sudo apt upgrade;
```

### Table of contents 

You can add a table of contents to a page by including the following in the markdown file: 

```markdown
<!-- toc --> 
```

The table of contents is then rendered in that position. You do not need the tocstop part, only gitbooks renders that (unsure why). 

### Equations

The website supports inline or block `LaTeX` equations. The easiest way to add such equations is through a `MathJax` compatible markdown writer - Typora for example.

Example of inline equation: $$ a x^2 + bx + c = 0 $$

Example of math-block: 
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$


### Hint blocks 

You can add hint blocks: 

```markdown 
{% hint style='info' %}
Important info: this note needs to be highlighted
{% endhint %}
```

There are four styles: info (default), tip, danger, and warning. Examples are below. 


{% hint style='info' %}
This is an info block.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
This is a tip block.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='danger' %}
This is a danger block. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='warning' %}
This is a warning block.
{% endhint %}

### Including Images

Images can be added and centred by using the syntax

```markdown
<center><img src="IMAGE_RELATIVE_PATH" style="zoom:100%;" /></center>
```

It is important to use a relative path, as an absolute path would be broken when the image is pushed to github.
