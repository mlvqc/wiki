This paper develops an architecture which allows for parallel addressing of silicon spin qubits, while solving the tunability issue through 'floating memory gate electrodes' that can be routinely reset, similar to dynamic random access memory. Their architecture requires $$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$$ lines for $$N $$ qubits. 

##### Physical Architecture
